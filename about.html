	  <p><h3>Population</h3>Las Vegas was settled in 1905 and officially incorporated in 1911. At the close of the 20th century, it was the most populated American city founded within that century (a similar distinction was earned by Chicago in the 19th century).
	  Population growth has accelerated since the 1960s, and between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled, increasing by 85.2%. Rapid growth has continued into the
	  21st century, and according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had 651,319 residents in 2019,with a metropolitan population of 2,227,053</p>

	 <h3> Government</h3>
      Las Vegas operates on a council-manager system. The city manager is responsible for the daily operations of government and administration. The city council comprises seven members, including six members elected by ward as well as the mayor, 
      who presides over the council. All serve four-year terms. The council and the city manager’s office oversee a number of commissions and boards.

     The major attractions in Las Vegas are the casinos and the hotels, although in recent years other new attractions have begun to emerge.
     Most casinos in the downtown area are located on Fremont Street, with The STRAT Hotel, Casino & Skypod as one of the few exceptions. Fremont East, adjacent to the Fremont Street Experience, was granted variances to allow bars to be closer together, similar to the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, the goal being to attract a different demographic than the Strip attracts.

     <h4>Downtown casinos</h4>
     Main article: Downtown (Nevada gaming area)
     The Golden Gate Hotel and Casino, located downtown along the Fremont Street Experience, is the oldest continuously operating hotel and casino in Las Vegas; it opened in 1906 as the Hotel Nevada.
     The year 1931 marked the opening of the Northern Club (now the La Bayou).The most notable of the early casinos may have been Binion's Horseshoe (now Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel) while it was run by Benny Binion.
     Boyd Gaming has a major presence downtown operating the California Hotel & Casino, the Fremont Hotel & Casino, and the Main Street Casino. The Four Queens also operates downtown along the Fremont Street Experience.
     Downtown casinos that have undergone major renovations and revitalization in recent years include the Golden Nugget Las Vegas, The D Las Vegas (formerly Fitzgerald's), the Downtown Grand Las Vegas (formerly Lady Luck), the El Cortez Hotel & Casino, and the Plaza Hotel & Casino.[57]
     <h4>Las Vegas Striph4
     Main article: Las Vegas Strip
     The center of the gambling and entertainment industry is located on the Las Vegas Strip, outside the city limits in the surrounding unincorporated communities of Paradise and Winchester in Clark County. The largest and most notable casinos and buildings are located there.[58]</p>

      <p><h3>Climate of Las Vegas</h3>
      Las Vegas is hot and dry for most of the year. The average daily temperature is 68 °F (20 °C); the average high is 80 °F (27 °C) and the average low is 56 °F (13 °C). January is the coldest month, with average daily temperatures ranging from 57 °F (14 °C) to 37 °F (3 °C); freezing temperatures are uncommon in the valley but normal for the surrounding foothills. July is the hottest month, 
      with average daily highs and lows of 104 °F (40° C) and 78 °F (26 °C).</p>

     <p><h3>Impact of growth on water supply</h3>
     A growing population means the Las Vegas Valley used 1.2 billion US gallons (4.5×109 l) more water in 2014 than in 2011. Although water conservation efforts
     implemented in the wake of a 2002 drought have had some success, local water consumption remains 30 percent more than in Los Angeles, and over three times 
     that of San Francisco metropolitan area residents. The Southern Nevada Water Authority is building a $1.4 billion tunnel and pumping station to bring water
     from Lake Mead, has purchased water rights throughout Nevada, and has planned a controversial $3.2 billion pipeline across half the state. By law, the 
     Las Vegas Water Service District "may deny any request for a water commitment or request for a water connection if the District has an inadequate supply of water."
     However, limiting growth on the basis of an inadequate water supply has been unpopular with the casino and building industries.</p>
